**Rive code:**

The RIVE model aims at representing the biogeochemical functioning of 
aquatic system, by simulating concentrations of oxygen and nutrients 
dissolved (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-, SiO2) and particulate (PIP, BSi), 
suspended matter, dissolved and particulate organic carbon (3 classes 
of biodegradability), dissolved gases (CO2, N2O et CH4). Biological 
compartments are represented by 3 taxonomic classes of phytoplankton 
(diatoms, chlorophyceae, and cyanobacteria), 2 types of zooplankton 
(rotifers with short generation time and microcrustaceans with long 
generation time), 2 types of heterotrophic bacteria (small autochthonous 
and large allochthonous) as well as nitrifying bacteria. Faecal bacteria 
(free and attached) are also considered as state variables. The model also
 takes into account benthic variables (benthic organic matter, inorganic 
 particulate phosphorus, benthic biogenic silica).

**Rive parameter values :**

The value of the parameters related to the physiology of organisms and the
kinetics of physical-chemical processes, have been determined, for most of
them, through experiments or direct measurements. Their values have a great
degree of genericity, at least for a given climatic regime, and do not require
to be adjusted.  
Two set of parameters are provided, for reservoir and river systems respectively.
These set of parameters may slightly differ from their original publication values. 
Please always refer to the **RIVE website** (https://www.federation-fire.cnrs.fr/rive/?q=rive-compartments),
where parameters of the RIVE kinetics are defined together with associated research
papers.
